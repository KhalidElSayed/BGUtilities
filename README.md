## About

After growing tired of always writing a lot of (what felt like) boilerplate Objective-C over and over again, I decided to make a bunch of useful utilities to make my life easier, and by proxy, yours too. This is an ever-growing repository of useful functions that should help you in development. I encourage you to read through their implementation so that you understand what's happening in the background and don't get comfortable with an extremely abstracted up representation of those functions.

## Installation

All of the important classes are located in the <code>Classes</code> top-level directory in this repository. These are the ones you'll need:

* <code>NSString+BGStringUtilities.{h,m}</code>
* <code>UIView+BGViewUtilities.{h,m}</code>
* <code>BGSystemUtilities.{h,m}</code>
* <code>BGUtilities.h</code>

The last class, <code>BGUtilities.h</code> is an aggregate of all of classes above it, meaning you only have to <code>#import "BGUtilities.h"</code> in any classes you'd like to get all of the methods in this suite.

**Cocoapods**

Cocoapods coming soon.
